Description: The table.one() function produces summary statistics and performs hypothesis tests for all variables in a supplied data frame, 
and it wraps the results in LaTeX or RMarkdown and documents the tests used for each variable in the table’s footnotes.
    The function automatically detects whether each variable in the supplied data frame is continuous or categorical. 
If the variable is continuous, and the distance between the mean and median is > 0.25 standard deviations, the function performs a
Wilcoxon rank-sum test and presents the median and inter-quartile range; otherwise, it performs a t-test and presents the mean and 
standard deviation. If the variable is categorical, the function presents a frequency table and performs a chi-squared test when expected 
cell counts are all at least 5 or a Fisher’s exact test when any cell count < 5. Alternatively, the user can specify which test to use for
each column instead of allowing these algorithms to make the decision. 
    The user can specify the grouping variable, precision of continuous variables, precision of p-values, the table’s caption, and 
the LaTeX label and font size.
